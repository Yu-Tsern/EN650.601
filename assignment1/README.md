# EN650.601 Assignment 1 

## Overview
There are two hands-on experiments you are going to implement in this assignment. One is about an important web application security policy; while the other is an real-life attack if such policy is not enforced. Both of them are from [SEED Project](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/index.html). It is strongly recommended that you do the Same Origin Policy Exploration lab first since it makes you familiar with the lab environment and go through some computer network basics. It is a lot more easier for you to do the second lab after you finished the first one.

## Setup the Environment
Load the [VM image](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/SEEDUbuntu12.04.zip) to your Virtualbox or VMware, and be sure to read the [User Manual](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Ubuntu12_04_VM/Ubuntu12_04_VM_Manual.pdf) carefully before you start working on the labs below. Specifically, you might want to pay some attention to the descriptions of Firefox extensions, Elgg web application, and Collabtive web application in section 3.2. 


## [Web Same-Origin-Policy Exploration Lab](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs/Web/Web_SOP_Collabtive/)
